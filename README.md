# django-template-hierarchy1

THIS IS A SOLO CLASSWORK

Start from scratch. Create a new movie application with name, yearReleased, ageAllowed, and genre attributes.
Create a base html file with a jumbotron and footer. Make sure to include an image somewhere. Use that base.html file for an index, about, and test page. Make sure each page is called by a different route. Present your database data on the index page.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> use other students as help until they are finshed with their classwork. Use instructions provided by the tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) as a starting point.
